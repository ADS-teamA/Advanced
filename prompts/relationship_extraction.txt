Extract semantic relationships between entities in the following legal document text.

**Entities** (extracted from this text):
{entities_str}

**Relationship Types**:
- superseded_by: Old standard → New standard (e.g., "GRI 306:2016" superseded_by "GRI 306:2020")
- supersedes: New standard → Old standard (inverse of superseded_by)
- references: Document A → Document B (e.g., "GRI 303" references "ISO 14001")
- issued_by: Standard → Organization (e.g., "GRI 306" issued_by "GSSB")
- developed_by: Standard → Organization
- published_by: Document → Organization
- effective_date: Standard → Date (e.g., "GRI 303" effective_date "2018-07-01")
- expiry_date: Contract → Date
- covers_topic: Standard → Topic (e.g., "GRI 306" covers_topic "waste management")
- contains_clause: Document → Clause
- applies_to: Regulation → Location
- mentioned_in: Entity → Chunk (for provenance)

**Document Text**:
{chunk_content}

**Output Format** (JSON array):
[
  {{
    "source_entity_id": "E1",
    "relationship_type": "superseded_by",
    "target_entity_id": "E2",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "evidence": "GRI 306:2020 supersedes GRI 306:2016"
  }}
]

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Process**:
Before extracting relationships, follow these steps:
1. For each entity pair (E1, E2), ask: "Is there a stated relationship?"
2. Determine relationship TYPE based on context and relationship types list
3. Assess confidence:
   - 0.95-1.0: Explicit statement (e.g., "X supersedes Y")
   - 0.80-0.94: Clear inference from context
   - 0.60-0.79: Implied relationship, requires interpretation
   - <0.60: Uncertain, likely exclude
4. Extract evidence - exact quote supporting the relationship
5. Only return relationships with confidence >= {min_confidence}

**Evidence Quality Guidelines**:
- Evidence must be exact text from document
- Should be minimal (1-2 sentences max)
- Must clearly support the relationship type
- Keep within {max_evidence_length} characters

**Instructions**:
1. Identify ALL relationships between the entities above that are present in the text
2. Only use relationship types: {rel_types_str}
3. For each relationship, provide:
   - source_entity_id: Source entity ID (E1, E2, etc.)
   - relationship_type: Type of relationship
   - target_entity_id: Target entity ID
   - confidence: Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
   - evidence: Supporting text snippet (max {max_evidence_length} chars)
4. Only include relationships with confidence >= {min_confidence}
5. Evidence must be exact text from the document
6. Return valid JSON array

**Output** (JSON array only):
